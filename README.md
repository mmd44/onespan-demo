# OneSpan - Android Intermediate Interview

We want to evaluate your ability to update a project by applying the **best coding practices**. 
Keep in mind that we will have a code review session together and that you will have to justify the choices you made.

## Requirements
- **Carefully consider the architecture**
- Use the Kotlin programming language
- Write a couple of unit tests
- Prepare a hosted Git repository or ZIP archive that you'll bring to the interview

Don't hesitate to list the things that you would add or improve if you had more time.

## Instructions

API to use: https://catfact.ninja

1. When opening the app, show a list of cat **breeds** retrieved from the API
2. During the network request, show a loader instead of the list

You might notice bad practices or issues in the code, that's intentional. Feel free to improve them as much you can.
